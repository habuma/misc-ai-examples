# Misc AI Examples

This repository contains a collection of Generative AI Examples that I have
created that are not based on Spring AI. If you're looking for my Spring AI
examples, those are at https://github.com/habuma/spring-ai-examples.

## Backstory

Why create any Generative AI code that isn't based on Spring AI?

I love Spring AI. So much, in fact, that I wrote [a book about it](https://www.manning.com/books/spring-ai-in-action). I believe that Spring AI is the best
way to create any GenAI project.

However, in the interest of not getting tunnel vision and to see what other
GenAI libraries and frameworks are like, I will occasionally tinker with
non-Spring AI stuff. This experience stretches my mind not only in terms of the
various GenAI libraries, but also gives me a chance to flex my muscles on
languages other than Java that I don't get a chance to work with on a day-to-day
basis.

I hope you enjoy this repository of various GenAI examples (as well as my other
collection of Spring AI examples).
